ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies
By:Sam Knight UCID:30039472

The topic for this project is hiking, fishing, and camping on the Sunshine Coast in BC. I chose this because this is where I grew up and those three activities are what I enjoy.

There are four html files for this website. index.html is the home page, basically this is just a semi-good looking intro page with self-made "buttons" that lead to the other 4 pages. The home page is also where is used an .scss file to style it. This page has all three sass requirements.

the fishing.html file is the Fishing page. Here there is a heading followed by a two-column bootstrap layout with text in the left container, and a table and list in the right container. In the table there are links to popular fishing locations which make use of the bootstrap button tool. There is also a navigation bar in the top container that can take you to any of the other pages. This nav bar is similar in the hiking.html and camping.html.

The hiking page is fairly basic with a single column format. The nav bar, some text, and a button that links you to sunshine coast tourism page where there is a bunch of different trails to hike.

camping.html is once again a two-column layout with a nav bar in the top section. Text in the left container, and links to google maps showing popular camping spots in the right container.

All images used as backgrounds were taken from google images.

For this Project I prioritized learning how to use html over interesting content. This is why the pages are fairly short and not overly filled. There are 3 .css files for the pages (.scss for the home page). These 3 .css files could have been made into a single file and shared amongst the pages. I chose to make a .css file for each page because it helped me practice more, and I felt it was a better way for me to learn. In the future I would keep only 1 .css file for similar styled pages.
